Here, we have a computer to do all the heavy lifting of computing convolutions and plotting things for us, so we can more easily explore how these systems behave when given longer or more complicated input signals. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Continuous (Interpolated with `plt.plot`) vs Discrete (Stem with `plt.stem`) Plots\n\nWhile we're still considering our signals as discrete-time entities in this lab, many of them will be fairly long, containing hundreds or even thousands of signal values. As a result, you should **use `plt.plot` for plotting all signals in this lab, unless told otherwise**. \n\nWe used `plt.stem` almost exclusively in Lab 1, but stem plots have two major disadvantages which continuous-time plots (i.e. ones generated with `plt.plot`, which interpolates your signals) don't suffer from:\n- It's difficult to overlay multiple signals on the same stem plot and visually compare them.\n- Stem plots' rendering times scale *significantly* worse with the length of the signal being plotted.\n    - Just to get a sense for how bad a stem plot is at scale, we compared times for plotting with `plt.stem` against `plt.plot` on a 2015 MacBook Pro. On average, for a length 1000 rect, `plt.plot` took ~100 ms and `plt.stem` took 2-3 seconds; for a length 10000 rect, `plt.plot` took ~200 ms and `plt.stem` took 1.5-2 ***minutes***.\n    - Remember the demo in Q3c of Lab 1 where we repeatedly convolved rects and saw that we eventually get a Gaussian (the bell curve)? You probably noticed that it took longer and longer to display the successive results - the issue wasn't that the convolutions were taking long due to the signal length increasing (the convolution runtime was increasing with the signal length, but negligibly so); rather the repeated stem plotting was the bottleneck.\n    \nThe two reasons listed above are some reasons why almost all plots you'll see in real world applications are interpolated. Keep in mind that there's actually a more complicated interplay going on between the continuous and discrete realms when doing digital processing of signals:\n1. A continuous time signal $x(t)$ is sampled at some rate $T$, giving $N$ samples at integer multiples of $T$ as $x(nT)$. We then define $x[n] = x(nT)$, a discrete time signal, which we can work with on the computer; note that $n = 0,1,..., N-1$ since we only have $N$ samples. Most practical signals are finite in duration, however, and so $N$ can be chosen to be sufficiently high to capture the entire signal.\n2. Processing is done on $x[n]$ on a computer, to produce some related signal $y[n]$.\n3. $y[n]$ is plotted as a continuous-time signal via interpolation.\n\nMuch like the conventions generally discussed of what \"zero\" means as a time index, this is one of the nuances of how signals and systems is done in practice that you get used to with experience.\n\nIn this lab, some of the signals we'll use are just made up \"test signals\" so we can experiment with different filters, in which case the above steps 1-3 aren't relevant. However, in other parts, we'll be using some real world data, and it's good to keep 1-3 straight in your head."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='q1'></a>\n# Q1: The 1D Edge Detector\n\nThe 1D edge detector is used in signal processing to, as you may have guessed from the name, detect edges, or jumps in a signal's amplitude. It's referred to as 1D to distinguish it from 2D edge-detecting filters used in image processing — basic signals only containing amplitude versus time information are referred to as \"1D\" whereas images are often considered as \"2D\" signals. Videos are considered \"3D\" signals, with time (as you go from frame to frame) being the third dimension. Almost all signals you'll see in EE 120 will be 1D.\n\nThe impulse response of a 1D edge detector is defined as:\n\n$$h(n) = \\delta(n) - \\delta(n - 1).$$\n\nIn this question, we'll explore several important properties of the edge detector.\n\nThe filter works by taking the difference between every pair of adjacent signal values. If you have a sequence of constant values, the filter will repeatedly output zeros, as there's no \"edge\". \n\nSimilarly, if the signal has a zero (at time $n-1$) followed by a 1 (at time $n$), the filter will output a 1 (at time $n$), indicating an edge of \"size\" 1. The filter also encodes information about the edge's \"direction\" - if you instead had a 1 (at time $n-1$) followed by a 0 (at time $n$), the output (at time $n$) would be -1.\n\nBecause of this, the 1D edge detector can be thought of as the discrete-time equivalent of taking a derivative, an idea we'll explore in greater depth in part b of this question.

This is, of course, very important in real-time systems since in real-time systems, we don't have access to the future.\n\nThe subscript \"SMA\" in the impulse response definition stands for *Simple Moving Average*, meaning all points are given equal weight in computing the average.

This just adds on the extra indices to the end of the existing ones based on how much the convolution stretches the signal $x$ by.\n        - Use `plt.legend` to label $x$ as \"True Signal\" and $\\hat{x}$ as \"Noised Signal after ?-point SMA\", where \"?\" should be replaced by the current filter size. Python's [format](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3) function may be of use here.\n\n**Note:** $\\hat{x}$ and $h$ change with each new filter size; $x$ and $y$ do not.\n\n**Hint 1:** It will be most informative to display our subplots as a column. Thus, your call to `plt.subplot` should look something like `plt.subplot(len(filt_sizes), 1, i)`  where `i` is a variable tracking which subplot we're currently on (i.e., it starts at 1, and should increase by 1 each time we create and apply a different moving average filter).\n\n**Hint 2:** Make sure to call `plt.show()` *after* you've created all your subplots (i.e., it should NOT be called inside a loop). You only call `plt.show()` once per figure, i.e. after you're finished generating all the subplots."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"filt_sizes = [2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"tags":[],"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"...","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A few sanity checks:\n- In all cases, the true signal should go from 0 to 1500 and look the same.\n- As we increase the filter length, the noised signal (post-filtering) will be stretched further and further out, occupying just over 1500 points for the length 2 and length 5 filters, and about 2000 points for the length 500 filter.\n- The peak of the noised signal (post-filtering) should always line up with the true signal's peak.

In this question, we'll use the MACD indicator as a vehicle for introducing the exponential moving average as well as some more uses of signal processing in financial analysis."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='q3a'></a>\n## Q3a: The Exponential Moving Average\n\nTo calculate the MACD of a stock, we first have to understand a new kind of moving average, called the *Exponential Moving Average* (EMA). What we did earlier is known as an Simple Moving Average (SMA) - all points are given equal weight. An EMA, on the other hand, places a greater weight, and therefore significance, on the most recent data points. The benefit of the EMA over the SMA is that the EMA reacts faster to recent price changes. \n\n### Derivation\n\nLet's take a look at where the EMA comes from. We can express the EMA using the following recursive Linear Constant Coefficient Difference Equation (LCCDE): \n\n$$y(n)=\\alpha\\cdot x(n) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot y(n-1)$$\n\nwhere $y(n)$ is the filter output at day $n$, and $x(n)$ is the stock price at day $n$. The output, $y(n)$, is a linear combination of the previous output of the filter, $y(n-1)$, and the current signal value, $x(n)$.\n\nNow, why is this an \"exponential\" moving average? It might not be obvious when written it in this form. Let's write it out step by step to try to unravel the recursion. We'll assume a causal filter, and that the input signal $x$ is zero for all $n < 0$, so that $n=0$ represents the first point of stock data we have, with others filled in as zero.\n\nSince we have a causal filter and $x(n) = 0$ for all $n<0$, we know that $y(n) = 0$ for all $n<0$, and:\n\n$\\begin{aligned}\n    y(0) &= \\alpha\\cdot x(0) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot y(-1) = \\alpha\\cdot x(0) \\\\\n    y(1) &= \\alpha\\cdot x(1) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot y(0) = \\alpha\\cdot x(1) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot \\alpha\\cdot x(0) \\\\\n    y(2) &= \\alpha\\cdot x(2) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot y(1) = \\alpha\\cdot x(2) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot (\\alpha\\cdot x(1) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot \\alpha\\cdot x(0)) = \\alpha\\cdot x(2) + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot \\alpha\\cdot x(1) + (1-\\alpha)^2\\cdot \\alpha\\cdot x(0) \\\\\n    &\\vdots \\\\\n    y(n) &= \\alpha\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(1-\\alpha)^k\\cdot x(n-k)\n\\end{aligned}$\n\nAha! Now that we have rewritten it, it's clear why we call this an EMA: we are weighting each previous data point with a value that decreases exponentially as we go further and further back in time.\n\n### An LTI Perspective: The Impulse Response of an EMA Filter\n\nWe can input a Kronecker delta to the EMA system by setting $x(n) = \\delta(n)$ to find its impulse response:\n\n$$h(n)=\\alpha\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(1-\\alpha)^k\\cdot \\delta(n-k)= \\alpha (1-\\alpha)^n u(n)$$\n\nwhich is just what we would expect: a (one-sided) decaying exponential!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Your Job\n\nFill in the `ema_filter` function below to create and return the impulse response of an EMA filter truncated after `length` points.

The LCCDE we originally gave describes an IIR filter, but we are using an FIR filter - after all, we can't store infinitely many values on a computer. In order to account for this, we truncate as is typically done, but we also renormalize so that the sum of the impulse response's coefficients, known as the DC gain, is 1.\n\n2.
