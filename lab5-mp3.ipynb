They cover everything from music to the dialogue from your favorite TV show. However, in order to adequately represent audio as a digital signal, we need to take many samples of the continuous time soundwave producing the audio. This is a consequence of the Nyquist criterion. The human ear can hear frequencies up to 20,000 Hz, so in order to adequately capture this frequency range, when recording digital audio, we must take at least 40,000 samples per second. The typical sampling frequency used for audio is 44.1 kHz, which is slightly above this limit.\n\nTo put this in perspective, suppose you download a 3 minute song. This is 180 seconds of audio sampled at 44.1kHz. This is close to a whopping 8 million samples! If we use a 16-bit integer to store each sample, the song in its raw form would take about 16 MB. When we store it in the raw form, we save it to a `.wav` file. However, these files will quickly become impractical to record and store because they are so huge. For this reason, we typically want to _compress_ our audio signals before saving them to a file.\n\nThe basic idea behind compression is that we can transform a signal into a _sparse_ representation. Sparse respresentations have very few nonzero values, and so we can store only the nonzero values and their locations instead of the entire signal. \n\n![Abstract Compression Diagram](images/compression-diagram.png)\n\nAll compression algorithms follow the same general procedure:\n1. **Transform** the input signal into a sparse representation.\n2. **Quantize** the result so we can represent each value of the signal with a finite number of bits.\n3. **Code** the quantized coefficients into a file by assigning bits to them in an intelligent manner.\n\nThere are many compression formats for Audio, but in this lab, we will cover a basic version of the most common one: MP3. In particular, we will focus on steps 1 and 2, Transform and Quantize, because those deal most directly with EE 120. If you are interested in the \"Code\" piece of compression, you can take classes like EE 121, EECS 126, and EE 229.\n\nTo start, lets load a 22 second audio clip of the song \"Dancing Queen\" by ABBA. Note that this song was sampled at 48 kHz, not 44.1kHz like typical audio waves. A 48 kHz sampling rate is typically used when we want to capture a song in very high fidelity, which of course, we must do for ABBA to truly appreciate their musical genius.\n\n### **Warning:** This might be loud, so turn down your volume when playing the audio."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"id":"0e002000","cell_type":"code","source":"fs, song = wavfile.read('dancing_queen_clip.wav')\n\nprint(\"Samples: %d, Sampling Frequency: %d\" % (song.size, fs))\nAudio(song, rate=fs)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"id":"bb3102ba","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The MP3 Standard\nMP3, or MPEG-1 Layer III encoding, is a powerful method to compress an audio signal with very little decrease in quality.\nIt makes use of **psychoacoustics**, or the science of how humans perceive sound, to discard much (sometimes over 90%!) of the information in an audio file without much of an audible difference.\n\nThe full encoding scheme (from reference [1], pictured below) is complicated and we won't go over the whole thing in detail.\n\nWe will focus on the following blocks, each labeled with their role in the Compression Pipeline:\n- Analysis Polyphase Filterbank, FFT, and MDCT (Transform).\n- Scalar and non-uniform quantizer (Quantize)\n\n![Full MP3 encoding scheme](images/encoding_diagram.png)\n\n*Note: In the above diagram, \"PCM input\" refers to the raw audio signal.*"},{"metadata":{},"id":"13f420ec","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Q1: MP3 Encoding"},{"metadata":{},"id":"3117042e","cell_type":"markdown","source":"_Encoding_ refers to the process of taking a signal and going to its compressed representation.

Polyphase Filterbanks are covered in detail in EE 123, but the basic idea is that this block uses a set of filters (a filter bank) to split the signals into its sub-bands. Each sub-band is an equal-sized section of the spectrum of the original signal which only overlaps with other sub-bands at the boundaries.\n\nBelow is an example of a spectrum divided into four sub-bands.\n![sub-bands](images/subbands.png)\n\nIf the original time-domain signal is length $N$, then each sub-band will also be length $N$. If there are $M$ sub-bands, then we need to store $NM$ total samples. MP3 is supposed to be a compression algorithm, so we don't want to increase the amount of data we store!\n\nIt turns out we can perform careful downsampling of each sub-band to only store $\\frac{N}{M}$ samples per sub-band while ensuring that we don't lose any information about the original signal (see **Step 2** and **Step 3** for more details).\n\n<!-- Suppose the original signal is of length $N$. In the time-domain, each sub-band will also be of length $N$, but in the Fourier Domain, each sub-band only occupies $\\frac{2\\pi}{M}$ of the entire spectrum, where $M$ is the number of sub-bands. Since each sub-band only occupies $\\frac{2\\pi}{M}$ of the entire spectrum, if we downsample each sub-band in the time-domain, it will then occupy the full frequency range $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. This means that we can split our signal into sub-bands and still keep the same number of total samples in memory. I.e after we downsample each sub-band, we will have $M$ sub-bands, each of length $\\frac{N}{M}$, leading to $N$ total samples.\nNote that downsampling does not cause any aliasing due to the fact that each sub-band is non-overlapping and equally-sized, so we can still reconstruct our original signal perfectly. -->\n\nA polyphase filterbank is a specific set of filters which accomplishes the goal in a very efficient manner.

If we apply $H_k(-\\omega)$, then we get the negative part of the subband $Z_k(\\omega) = H_k(-\\omega)X(\\omega)$. \n\nSince $x(n)$ is real, $X(-\\omega) = X^*(\\omega)$, so $Z_k(-\\omega) = Y^*(\\omega)$.

However, we need to be careful about how we split each sub-band into chunks.\n\nConsider a signal $x(n)$. If you split it into equally-sized chunks $x_k(n)$, that is identical to multipling it with a set of signals $v_k(n)$ where\n$$ v_k(n) = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{ if n is in chunk k } \\\\ 0 & \\text{ else.} \\end{cases} $$\n\nIn the frequency domain, for each resulting chunk $x_k(n) = v_k(n)x(n)$, this corresponds to $X_k(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} V_k * X(\\omega)$, where $V_k(\\omega)$ is a sinc function. This sinc function will cause what we call \"spectral leakage\" because the side-lobes of the sinc will smear the low frequency components into the high frequencies, causing high frequency distortions when we perform the convolution. \n\nBelow is the magnitude of $V_k(\\omega)$, in decibels ($20\\log_{10}|V_k(\\omega)|$). Note the prominent side-lobes!\n![sinc lobes](images/sinc_lobes.png)\n\nTo avoid this, we use special window functions which minimize the amount of spectral leakage that occurs.\n\nFor example, say we use a rectangular windowing function to isolate the blue section of the following sine wave.\n<img src=\"images/sin_to_window.png\" width=700px/>\n\nThe periodic extension of the window would be as follows:\n\n<img src=\"images/blocked_sin.png\"/>\n\nNote the sharp discontinuity at the end of each period!

Because cosines are the basis function, the MDCT of a real signal always has real coefficients. This is important for compression because if we had imaginary coefficients, we would have to store both the real and imaginary piece, essentially doubling the amount of information we need to store.\n\n\nUnlike some other variations on the DCT (discrete cosine transform), the MDCT is **lapped**, *i.e.*, designed to work well on blocks of data where consecutive blocks overlap by a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSee the section on the IMDCT (inverse MDCT) and time-domain aliasing cancellation for an in-depth description of where lapping comes into play.\nMost notably, the lapping in the MDCT allows us to perfectly reconstruct our signal even with a non-rectangular windowing function applied: In smoothing the edges of a window, the window function we use distorts our signal. However, for windowing functions that meet certain conditions (more on this later), we can window, take the MDCT, take the IMDCT, and then get our original signal back.\n\nThe analysis equation for the MDCT is as follows:\n$$X_k, k \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\} = \\sum_{n=0}^{2N-1} x(n) \\cos\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{N} \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N}{2}\\right)\\left(k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right].$$\n\nNote that the MDCT takes in $2N$ real inputs and produces $N$ real coefficients.\nThis is due to the principle underlying the MDCT, **time-domain aliasing cancellation (TDAC)**.\nWe discuss TDAC in some detail in the appendix, but it's pretty complicated.

This is a perfect reconstruction of the center section of $x(n)$!\n\n$[a, b]$ and $[e, f]$ cannot be fully reconstructed because they do not ovelap with anything. **This is why we zero-padded the ends of the signal in `apply_windowed_MDCT`!**\nThe $N$ elements at the beginning and end of the signal that we cannot reconstruct are just the zeros that we added, so we can reconstruct the full song with the IMDCT.\n\n### **Implementing IMDCT and TDAC**\n**IMDCT for Windowed Signals**\n\nWe'll forego the derivation for this part, but, for blocks of a signal produced by a window function $W(n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ such that $W[n=0:N]^2 + \\text{reverse}\\{W[N:2N]\\}^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\cdots & 1\\end{bmatrix}$, the IMDCT is\n$$x(n) = W(n)\\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k \\cos\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{N} \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N}{2}\\right)\\left(k + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right],$$\nand $x(n)$ can be reconstructed using the same time-domain aliasing cancellation technique as with non-windowed signals.\n\n**We can apply TDAC to reconstruct overlapped sections of the original signal as follows**:\n\nAssume we have a function $x(n)$ split into length-$2N$ blocks, where the second half of one block overlaps with the first half of the next, and that we have taken the MDCT of each block. Denote the $i$<sup>th</sup> block as $x_i(n)$. Also assume that we padded the beginning and end with $N$ zeros each before windowing.\n- Take the IMDCT of each block. The $i$<sup>th</sup> IMDCT output will be called $\\hat{x}_i(n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2N}$.\n- $x(n)$ can be reconstructed as follows:\n    $$x[n=iN:(i+1)N] = \\hat{x}_{i+1}[0:N] + \\hat{x}_{i}[N:2N].$$\n    If there are $K$ windows, we perform this process for $i=0$ to $K-1$."},{"metadata":{},"id":"ac9c0247","cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>"},{"metadata":{},"id":"efd63f6e","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Synthesis Filter Bank**\nFinally, we will reverse the operations done by the analysis filter bank.
