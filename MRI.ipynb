The fundamentals of MRI rely on physical properties of magnetism and the intracies of the Fourier transform. In fact, EE225E (the MRI class) only requires EE120 as a prerequisite.\n\nLet's go through a high-level overview of how MRI works. An MRI machine has very powerful magnetic coils, and when a patient is placed inside an MRI machine, the machine generates a powerful, uniform magnetic field $B_0$ around their body.  \n[<img src=\"images/scanner.PNG\" width=\"500\"/>](images/scanner.PNG)\n\nProtons inside the human body have their own magnetic moment and spins. Normally, the protons in the body are all spinning and pointing in different directions, so their magnetic moments cancel each other out. However, when a powerful magnetic field is applied to them, the protons all align their spins to $B_0$, resulting in a net magnetization. The spins will also begin resonating at the Larmor frequency, defined as $f = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B$. \n\n$\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and is specific to atoms. For a proton, $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} = 42.58 Mhz/Tesla$. \n\nMRI machines also have Radiofrequency (RF) coils for the purposes of excitation and signal reception. To generate a signal, a radiofrequency pulse $B_1$ corresponding to the resonant frequency is applied in the transverse plane to $B_0$. (add explanation and images). These rotating magnetization moments induce an electromotive force (EMF) in the RF receiver coil (which may or may not be the same coil used for excitation), and the generated signal is called a free induction decay. \n\nGeneralizing to 1D, the magnetization that is generated at position x can be expressed as $m(x)$, and because the magnetization vectors are rotating at frequency $\\omega$, the collected signal generated from position x is $m(x)e^{i\\omega(x)t}$ <span style=\"color:blue\"> [1] </span>. In our current setup, there is only a single frequency $w_0$, so this becomes $m(x)e^{i\\omega_0 t}$. The total collected signal across the entire image is $s(t) = \\int_x m(x)e^{i \\omega_0 t} dx$. We've now collected a signal from the entire sum of our image, since every spatial position has the same resonance frequency $\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$. This isn't quite useful - the collected signal is just a complex exponential with a constant magnitude.\n\nThe key idea here is to add a Gradient field, such that the resonance frequency is spatially varying instead of constant. The gradient field is an extra magnetic field $B_1$ in the same direction as $B_0$, except instead of being uniform, it varies with position in the transverse plane. For example, we could have a gradient that varies linearly in the x direction, such that $B_1(x) = Gx$ where G is a constant. Then, each spatial position will be mapped to a different temporal frequency, such that $\\omega(x) = \\omega_0 + \\gamma Gx$! \n\nThen, the signal generated from position x is $m(x)e^{i (\\omega_0 + \\gamma Gx) t}$ and the total collected signal is $s(t) = \\int_x m(x)e^{i (\\omega_0 + \\gamma Gx) t} dx = e^{i \\omega_0 t} \\int_x m(x) e^{i \\gamma Gx t} dx$. We can demodulate the signal to remove the $e^{i \\omega_0 t}$ term to get the baseband signal $\\hat{s}(t) = \\int_x m(x) e^{i \\gamma Gx t} dx = F(\\gamma G t)$ where $F(\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $m(x)$, the magnetization. Thus, we can collect data on the Fourier domain of magnetization signal as a function of spatial position, and the inverse Fourier transform allows us to get an image of the magnetization, or proton density of an image!\n\nDifferent tissues in the body have different hydrogen atom (proton) densities, and they emit signals with different strengths and patterns. By analyzing these signals, MRI can produce highly detailed images of the body's organs, soft tissues, bones, and other structures. \n\nIn addition to producing static images, MRI can also be used to produce dynamic images of the body in motion, such as blood flow or joint movement. This is achieved by using different MRI techniques that capture the movement and changes in the signals emitted by the hydrogen atoms in the body. \n\n\n<span style=\"color:blue\"> [1] </span>The actual signal equation is a lot more complicated - but we will use this generalized signal equation for the purposes of developing a basic understanding."},{"metadata":{},"id":"02cb9741","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Outline\nAs a recap, the basic idea behind MRI is that we use properties of magnetism to collect a signal corresponding to the frequency domain of an image, represented as  $\\hat{s}(t) = \\int_x m(x) e^{i \\gamma Gx t} dx = F(\\gamma G t)$,  where $F(\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of $m(x)$, the proton density of an object. The signal has to be processed digitally, so it is a discrete sampled version of the true signal. \n\nTo build an understanding of the relationship of the Fourier transform and MRI, we will explore some key ideas:\n\n1. Many signals are aperiodic, which means that they have an infinite number of Fourier components (a CTFT that extends infinitely long). However, $\\hat{s}(t)$ can only be sampled to a finite range (we can't sit there and scan for an infinite amount of time), which may cause reconstruction artifacts.\n2. We can only collect discrete samples of the frequency domain due to physical constraints of hardware. Images and signals in real life are continuous, but we can only collect discrete samples, which may cause aliasing.\n3. MR images are 2D or 3D - so we will learn about the multidimensional Fourier transform.\n4. Signals in EE120 are represented as a function of time, but images are instead a function of spatial position. Therefore, we will have to work with spatial frequency (kspace) instead of temporal frequency.\n5. We will apply all these ideas to real scan data!\n"},{"metadata":{},"id":"b9922e4e","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Helper Functions\nPlease use the following helper functions for questions 1 and 2.
