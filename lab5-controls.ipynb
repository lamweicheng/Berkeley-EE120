We can treat the system we are trying to control (called a plant) as a black box.\n* Designed well, closed-loop systems tend to be more robust to modeling imperfections, disturbances, and noise.\n* Feedback loops are often automated by computers, so a closed-loop system&mdash;such as the cruise control of a car&mdash;can compensate for error at a much greater frequency than a human operator can."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Background: Laplace Transform\n\nThe bilateral Laplace transform of a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is:\n$$X(s) \\triangleq \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-st} \\mathrm{d}t$$\nWe can view the Laplace transform as a generalization from the continuous-time Fourier transform, since the Laplace transform can represent a broader class of signals (in particular, signals with exponential envelopes). This is because while the Fourier transform represents a signal in terms of $e^{i\\omega t}$, the Laplace transform represents a signal in terms of $e^{st}$ where $s\\in\\mathbb{C}$.\nFor the special case $X(s)|_{s=i\\omega}$, we recover the CTFT of $x(t)$.\n\nLike the z-transform, its discrete-time analog, every Laplace transform is associated with a region of convergence (ROC)&mdash;a set of $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$ where the Laplace integral converges.\nFor rational Laplace transforms, the numerator and denominator polynomials can be factored into their roots, zeros and poles.\nROCs are bounded by vertical lines on which poles sit, so ROCs take the form of a right-sided half-plane, left-sided half-plane, or vertical strip.\n\nFor a CT-LTI system, the Laplace transform of its impulse response is called the transfer function of the system. This is often more useful than just the frequency response because it tells us how the system responds to signals that are complex exponentials: For an input $x(t) = e^{st}$, where $s=\\sigma + i \\omega$ is an arbitrary complex number, the corresponding output is $y(t) = H(s) e^{st}$ where $H$ is the Laplace transform of the system's impulse response $h$ (assuming the Laplace transform converges at $s$) [Prove it!].\n\nOnce critical property of the Laplace transform is the differentiation in time property.\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} \\Leftrightarrow sX(s) -x(0^{-})$$\n\nIf we apply this property to a causal Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) CT-LTI system $H$ that is governed by an LCCDE,\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^M a_m \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^m y(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^m} = \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^n x(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^n},\n$$\nthe transfer function is a rational functions of $s$,\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^N b_n s^n}{\\sum_{m=0}^M a_m s^m}\n$$\n\nThe values of $s$ for which the transfer function $H(s)$ is undefined are called the poles of the system. For systems governed by LCCDEs, there are the roots of the denominator of the transfer function.\n\n## Background: State Space\n\nDuring our study of CT-LTI systems, we saw how systems described by differential equations can be written compactly in a standard state-space form:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{x}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}(t) + \\mathbf{B} u(t), \\\\\ny(t) &= \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{x}(t) + D u(t),\\\\\n\\mathbf{x}(0) &= \\mathbf{x}_0,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere:\n* $u(\\cdot)$ is a scalar input signal (**not** necessarily the unit step),\n* $y(\\cdot)$ is a scalar output signal,\n* $\\mathbf{x}(\\cdot): \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ are $n$ intermediate states (also known as the system **trajectory**),\n* $\\mathbf{x}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are the initial conditions, and\n* $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}, D$ are appropriately sized matrices of constants.\n\nApplying the Laplace transform to each state variable, you can compute the transfer function of the overall system $u(t) \\to y(t)$ after assuming a zero initial condition $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ns\\mathbf{X}(s) &= \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{X}(s) + \\mathbf{B} U(s) \\\\\nY(s) &= \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{X}(s) + D U(s) \\\\\nH(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)} &= \\mathbf{C} (s\\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1} \\mathbf{B} + D\n\\end{aligned}$$\nThe beauty of the Laplace transform is that our differential equation has been turned into an algebraic one of polynomials in $s$, which greatly simplifies analysis and design.\nFor example, the poles of $H(s) = Y(s)/U(s)$ are a subset of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$$(s\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})^{-1} = \\frac{\\mathrm{adj}{(s\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})}}{\\det{(s\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{A})}}$$\n(The adjugate of a matrix $A$, denoted $\\mathrm{adj}(A)$ is computed from the cofactors of $A$, which are used in Laplace's formula for computing the determinant. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjugate_matrix) for more details.)\n\nIt is easy to check whether a causal system $u(t) \\to y(t)$ is BIBO-stable by checking whether the eigenvalues that are poles lie in the open left-half plane.

This is an example of open-loop control, where the control input we apply is independent of the variable we are trying to control. However, if our assumption of a constant disturbance is inaccurate, or we are unable to exactly cancel it with our applied torque, there will be a net torque that will cause the angle to drift from the value we want.\n\nSince it's not practical to cancel the disturbance with subtraction in the open-loop scheme, we try feedback (or closed-loop) control, where the control input is dependent on the variable we are trying to control:\n\n![Closed Loop System](diagrams/closed-loop.png)\n\nThe controller takes the error signal $e(t)$ and outputs a corresponding angular velocity signal $\\omega(t)$ to spin the flywheel at.\n\nNote that the flywheel has its own dynamics: it has its own moment of inertia $I_f > 0$ and angular velocity $\\omega(t)$.\n\nThe transfer function of $\\theta(t)$ w.r.t. the disturbance $w(t)$ is\n\n$$\\Theta(s) = \\frac{1}{I_y s^2} \\left[W(s) - I_f s C(s) \\Theta(s)\\right] \\implies H_{w\\to\\theta}(s) \\triangleq \\frac{\\Theta(s)}{W(s)} = \\frac{1}{I_y s^2 + I_f s C(s)}$$\n\nSince the transfer function of our controller $C(s)$ appears the in the denominator of the resulting transfer function, that means we can choose it to carefully place the poles of the system wherever we choose!\n\nThere are many choices for the controller $C(s)$.\nThe scheme we'll use is called proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, which uses a linear combination of the error signal, integrated error, and error derivative (current, past, and future error) to determine the velocity $\\omega(t)$:\n$$\\omega(t) = k_p e(t) + k_i \\int_0^t e(t^\\prime) \\mathrm{d}t^\\prime + k_d \\frac{\\mathrm{d}e(t)}{dt},$$\nwhere $k_p, k_i, k_d \\geq 0$ are coefficients (in the appropriate units) that determine the relative importance of each term.\n\nThe Laplace transforms of PID controllers take the form\n\n$$C(s) = k_p + \\frac{k_i}{s} + k_ds.$$\n\nThis comes from applying the differentiation in time property in conjuction with the integration in time property,\n\n$$\\int_0^{t}x(t)dt \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{s}X(s)$$\n\nThis means if we apply a PID controller to the system, our transfer function will become\n\n\\begin{align*}\n    H_{w\\to\\theta}(s) &= \\frac{1}{I_y s^2 + I_f s C(s)}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{I_y s^2 + I_f s \\left(k_p + \\frac{k_i}{s} + k_ds\\right)}\\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{(I_y + k_d I_f)s^2 + k_p I_f s + k_iI_f}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis corresponds to the LCCDE\n\n$$(I_y + k_d I_f)\\ddot{\\theta} + k_p I_f \\dot{\\theta} + k_i I_f \\theta = w.$$\n\nProportional (P), proportional-derivative (PD), and proportional-integral (PI) are also common variants where one or more terms is excluded.\nPID and its variants are quite popular in practical controller implementations because it is simple to approximate differentiation and integration with finite differencing and accumulators."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Q2(a): Disturbance Rejection\n\nNow, we want to simulate the closed-loop system with different sets of PID coefficients and see how well it does at rejecting a constant disturbance\n1.
